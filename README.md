# Affine_cipeher_cryptoanalysis
Лабораторная работа по криптоанализу афинной биграмной подстановки 

Before running the code change pathes in main() to suitable for your computer :)

Put your cipher_text (variant) into the file "ascii.txt" ( only ascii symbols [а-я] ))


Then you need to create files "outF.txt" "answer(onePT).txt" "all(allPT).txt" in your work directory.

It would find the correct key of affinity cipher and decrypt your "ascii.txt" with it. 
All steps of decryption are logged in "all(allPT).txt".
